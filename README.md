# I Refuse To Take a Serious Picture (The Dan Ross Story)

This is an image gallery I made using React, Node, SQL, and Express.  It is also a testament to the fact that my face refuses to act in a normal manner when a camera is placed in front of it.

### Getting Started

First, clone this repository and using the terminal install the npm dependencies.

 ```
 npm install
 ```

Then, using Postico or your preferred PostgreSQL client, execute the SQL queries found in `database.sql` -- first the `CREATE TABLE`, then the `INSERTS`.

Now, start the server.

```
npm run server
```

Once the server is running, open a new terminal tab (`cmd`+`t`) and start the client.

```
npm run client
```

If this does not automatically open `localhost:3000` in your preferred browser, do so and enjoy my dumb face!

### Usage

When first using this image gallery, you should calibrate your system by looking at your own hands, then turning them over and looking at the backs of them with a sense of wonder.

Now, go my child, look at pictures!  Click on pictures to see insightful commentary!  Like things!  Like things again!  Marvel at the number of likes you have accrued!

And Jesus wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
