# I Refuse To Take a Serious Picture
## The Dan Ross Story

This is an image gallery I made using React, Node, SQL, and Express.  It is also a testament to the fact that my face refuses to act in a normal manner when a camera is placed in front of it.

### Getting Started

First, clone this repository and using the terminal install the npm dependencies.

 ```
 npm install
 ```

Then, using Postico or your preferred PostgreSQL client, execute the SQL queries found in `database.sql` -- first the `CREATE TABLE`, then the `INSERTS`.

Now, start the server.

```
npm run server
```

Once the server is running, open a new terminal tab (`cmd`+`t`) and start the client.

```
npm run client
```

If this does not automatically open `localhost:3000` in your preferred browser, do so and enjoy my dumb face!
